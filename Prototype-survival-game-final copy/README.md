Introduction

Boxed In is a survival game that challenges you to navigate through a hostile environment filled with enemies and magical elements. Your survival depends on your ability to attack enemies and wisely use the mysterious Magic Ball.

Controls

- Use the arrow keys to move your character.
	 - Left arrow: Rotate left.
 	 - Right arrow: Rotate right.
 	 - Up arrow: Move forward.
 	 - Down arrow: Move backward.
- Spacebar: Jump.
- Mouse: Look left and right for a better perspective.

- When you approach an enemy (cone), press F to initiate an attack. Keep pressing F repeatedly when close to the enemy, as it might take several hits to defeat them. You must be close and in range for the attack to register.

Gameplay

Survive the hostile environment by using your character's abilities and attacking enemies. Collect gold as you progress, but be cautious of the Magic Ball gold draining abilities and enemies attacks.

Magic Ball

The Magic Ball is a unique element in the game. To use it:

Get within a close proximity to the Magic Ball.
It will heal your health up to 100 in intervals.
Be aware that it will also steal your gold until it reaches zero, even if you are not healing. Manage your gold carefully.

Thank you for playing Boxed In!
